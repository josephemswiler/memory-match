# Memory Match!

See the project here: [Memory Match!](https://josephemswiler.github.io/memory-match/ "Memory Match!")

Memory Match is a simple memory game built with [React](https://reactjs.org/ "React"). To play, the user clicks a square to reveal an image. The goal is to find a matching image by clicking a second square. If a match is not found at the second square, the two different images are hidden. Once all the pairs have been correctly selected, the game is over!
